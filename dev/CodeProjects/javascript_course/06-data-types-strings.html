               <h3>Data Types</h3>
               
                <p>
                    In the previous lesson we learned that we can use variables to store values. These values can be of different types.
                    The most basic ones are <strong>Strings</strong>, which are text values like "John", "I'm 34 years old" or "www.google.com" 
                    and <strong>Numbers</strong>.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    These two types plus the <strong>Booleans</strong> (true or false) and <strong>Null and Undefined</strong>, 
                    are know as the <strong>primitive data types</strong>. 
                    Besides the primitives we also have two important data types which are the <strong>Arrays</strong> 
                    and <strong>Objects</strong>. We are going to explore
                    each of these data types in details. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To find out what's the type of a variable we can use the typeof operator:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    var firstName = "John";  
    
    console.log( typeof firstName ); // the result will be "string"

    var age = 40;  
    
    console.log( typeof age ); // the result will be "number"
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h3>Strings</h3>

                <p>
                    Text values are called strings. Actually the best definition for a string is a sequence of characters.
                    Strings are identified with single or double quotation marks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let's create some example variables to store string values:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    var firstName = "John";  // we can use double quotation marks
    
    var lastName = 'Doe'; // or single quotation marks
    
    var passportNumber = 'XYZ0123';  
    
    var phoneNumber = "909299999";
    
    var email = 'john_doe@gmail.com';
    
    var bio = "John Doe started his web developer career in 2010 and has contributed to many important projects, like...";
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Note that in the examples above we have the phoneNumber value composed by numbers only. 
                    Why is it string and not number type?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although the value is composed by numbers only, it won't be used in any calculations so the
                    string type is more indicated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand if we are to store the year of birth of a 
                    person we might as well use the number type, because we can subtract the current year by the 
                    year of birth to find the person's age.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are important operations that can be done with strings, as shown below:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><h5>Concatenation</h5></li>
                </ul>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    var firstName = "John";

    var lastName = "Doe";

    var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

    console.log(fullName); 

    // The result will be "John Doe"

    // Therefore the plus sign (+) is used for concatenation with string values.
                    </code>
                </pre>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><h5>Length and Index</h5></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    As said above, strings are sequences of characters. Those sequences has a size (length)
                    and each of the characters has their specific position in the sequence, which is the index.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    var firstName = "John";

    console.log(firstName.length); // The result will be 4

    /* 
    The length property of a string represents its number of characters.
    Each character has its own index, starting from zero.
    White spaces also count. 
    */

    console.log(firstName[0]); // The result will be 'J'
    

    // We can access each character of a string using their index inside brackets. 

                    </code>
                </pre>

                <ul>
                    <li><h5>String replace</h5></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    There are useful ways of using the replace method. Let's say we have the following
                    url: "https://www.udemy.com". We can easily remove the https:// by replacing it with an empty string.
                    To use this method first inform the piece of text you want to replace and then the piece of text to 
                    replace it.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    var url = "https://www.udemy.com";

    console.log( url.replace( "https://" , "" ) ); // It will show "www.udemy.com"

                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    There are many other operations we can do with strings but we are not going to
                    explore them now. If you want you can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp">learn more here</a>.
