                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    var birthYear = 1982; 
    var price = 16.99;  // decimal places must be separated by a dot.

                    Numbers are used for all sorts of calculations, from simple math operations to complex expressions.

    var subtraction = num1 - num2;
    var division = num1 / num2;
    var multiplication = num1 * num2;

    var average = (num1 + num2) / 2;

    /*
    Parenthesis can be used to form expressions. In this case it was used to define the order
    of the operations. Without parenthesis, the division would have been done before the sum,
    resulting in an incorrect average.

                </ul>

                <p>
                    We can do more advanced operations using the built-in Math object and its methods.
                    Don't worry if you still have trouble undestanding the concept of objects and 
                    methods, all of this will be clear later in the course.

    var power = Math.pow(2,4);  /*  This does 2<sup>4</sup>, which is 16. */

    var roundedNumber = Math.round(2.7); // Rounds to the nearest integer. Result: 3

    var roundUp = Math.ceil(4.3) // Rounds to the next integer. Result: 5
    
    var roundDown = Math.floor(4.6) // Rounds to the current integer. Result: 4

    var squareRoot = Math.sqrt(36) // Square root. Result: 6

    var randomNumber = Math.random() // The result is a random number between 0 and 1

                </ul>

                <p>
                    In Javascript, every data type is an object and has its own methods. This is something 
                    that can be a bit confusing at first but it will become clearer as we advance in the course.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we have a variable with a number assigned to it, we can use a few methods:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    var myNumber = 3.78633;
    
    // toFixed() rounds it to a fixed number of decimal places

    console.log( myNumber.toFixed(2) ); // will show 3.79
    console.log( myNumber.toFixed(4) ); // will show 3.7863

                <ul>
                    <li><h5>Incremental operators</h5></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    One common set of operations we usually need to do with numbers is incrementing and decrementing.
                    When we start using loops this will turn out to be essential.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let's say we want to increment 5 to the current value of a variable. We have two ways
                    of doing it.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">

    var myNumber = 20;
    myNumber = myNumber + 5;
    console.log(myNumber); // The result will be 25

                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    This structure variable = variable + value can be simplified with the incremental operator (+=)
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">

    myNumber = 1;
    myNumber += 5;
    console.log(myNumber); // The result will be 6

    // We can also use *=, /= e -= for incremental multiplication, division and subtraction

                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    The incremental operator += also works with strings:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    var name = "John";
    name += " ";
    name += "Doe";

    console.log(name); // The console will show "John Doe"
    
                    </code>
                </pre>
                

                <h4>Type conversions</h4>

                <p>
                    There will be cases when type conversions will be necessary. Let's say we receive
                    numbers from text inputs and they comes as strings (this is a very common situation).
                    In order to use them in calculations we'll need to convert them to numbers first.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
    var firstNumber = "21"; 
    var secondNumber = "4";

    console.log(firstNumber + secondNumber);
    // The result will be 214 because the plus sign does concatenation on strings.

                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    To convert strings to numbers we can use ParseInt (for integers) or parseFloat (for numbers with decimals) functions.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="javascript">
   
    var firstNumber = "21"; 
    var secondNumber = "4";

    console.log(  parseInt(firstNumber) +  parseInt(secondNumber) );
    //The result will be 25

    // To do the opposite we can use the toString method.

    var yearOfBirth = 1986;
    
    console.log(yearOfBirth.toString() +  " is the year I was born.");

                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                        Have you noticed the difference in the structure of number and string conversions? One was done with
                        parseInt(firstNumber) while the other was done with yearOfBirth.toString(). This happens because
                        the first one is a Javascript global function while the other is a method of the string object. In
                        Javascript every data type is an object.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    A bit confusing, right? Don't worry about understanding this concept now. When you get more 
                    comfortable with the language,
                    it will be understood naturally.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're unsure on how to do the conversion, just type on Google "JS string to integer" or 
                    "JS number to string" and you can confirm the way you should do it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Always keep an eye on the type of your variables because many times a lack of conversion
                    goes unnoticed and can lead to bugs in your code. 
                </p>
